## Explanation

This game is a simple 2D platformer that conforms to the game jam theme of 'growth' and limitation of only using assets from Kenney.nl. You use the arrow keys for movement, and press 'space' to interact with mushrooms. The goal is to reach the flag of each level utilising the mushrooms, which grow when watered.

## Tools

I decided to use the Godot game engine for this project. Godot is a lightweight engine which also utilises its own python-like language for scripting. While I wanted to experiment with Unity, I did not have enough time, as I had already lost some of the 48 hours, and I was already familiar with Godot from my previous two game jams. Despite my limitations, I produced a game that I was proud of, and which achieved 18th overall out of 301 entries.
