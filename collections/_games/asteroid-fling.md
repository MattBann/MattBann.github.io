## Explanation

This game is a top-down space survival game that uses the game jam theme of 'rotation' and limitation of only using assets from [Kenney.nl](https://www.Kenney.nl). The goal is to survive as long as possible in your space-station against waves of alien spaceships. You are only equipped with an asteroid scoop and a mining laser, and you are spinning. Use up/w and down/s to extend and retract the scoop, press space with an asteroid in the scoop to release it towards aliens and press f to fire the mining laser to break up larger asteroids into smaller asteroids you can scoop up.

## Tools

This was my first attempt at a game jam, and I had only a little experience with any game engines. The engine I had used the most was Godot, which is a lightweight engine which uses its own python-like language for scripting. While it may seem like having to learn a new programming language would make learning game development more difficult, I found it helped my understanding to start fresh, since game scripting is somewhat different from traditional programming. I didn't expect to get a high rating during the voting period, however my game came 70th out of 364 entries, which I was more than happy with.
