## Explanation

Into the Darkness is a 2D skill-based platformer where you can't see more than a short distance around yourself, except where space is lit up by lanterns or sunlight. The goal is not only to reach the end, but also make it back to the entrance. The challenges include large jumps using a dash action and wall climbs, both inspired by Celeste, as well as moving platforms, crumbling platforms and red-eyed creatures that disappear in torch-light.

## Tools

For this game jam, since I had more time than previous jams, I decided to explore Godot's lighting system, and based the game's mechanics around that.
The 'return to the entrance' part was put in to (at least try to) incorporate the theme, although added more work than I would care to admit.
I learnt a lot about game lighting from this project, as well as about platformers, since my previous and first platformer [Mushroom Madness]({% link _games/mushroom-madness.md %}) had a much smaller scope.
Overall this game didn't perform as well in ratings compared to my previous jams, coming in 412th out of 735, however I don't mind this since I took it more as a learning opportunity than anything else.
