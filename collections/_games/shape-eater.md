## Explanation

This game is a top-down survive and thrive game that fits around the game jam theme of 'choose a side' and limitation of being geometric in nature. Your shape follows the mouse, and you can press 'space' to use your ability. At the start of the game you choose to be either 'red' or 'blue'. The goal is to gain as much 'mass' as possible by consuming circles and smaller shapes. The red shapes have the ability to fire a projectile that reduces the 'mass' of other shapes, while the blue shapes have a speed boost ability to escape pursuers.

## Tools

I decided to use the Godot game engine for this project, as I was still fairly new to game development and wanted to expand and reinforce my understanding of one game engine before trying another. Godot is a lightweight engine which uses its own python-like language for scripting. This was my second time participating in a game jam, my first resulting in 'Asteroid Fling', and my game came 74th out of 255 entries.
