The website you're on now!

## Overview

I built this website to showcase my previous projects as well as provide somewhere to write blog posts (though don't expect them to arrive with any regular frequency).
The current website you see now is build using Jekyll with the [TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) and hosted on GitHub pages, and replaces a website built using static html and the bootstrap framework, which was a nightmare to maintain.
