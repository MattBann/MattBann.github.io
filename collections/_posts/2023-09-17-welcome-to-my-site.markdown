This is my new website, built from the ground up using Jekyll.
It's purpose is to be a place to show my work outside of University, including coding projects, games and other things.
You can find out more about the website on it's [dedicated project page]({% link _projects/website.md %}).

That's all for this post, but hopefully there should be some more blog posts coming in the future, so keep an eye out for them!
